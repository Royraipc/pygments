== Welcome

http://pygments.appspot.com serves as a simple API to access the Pygments syntax highlighting library for Python. It's designed for use in web applications that can't support their own installation of Pygments. It's running Python 2.5 and Pygments 1.2 on Google App Engine, in case you're curious. 

Note: this isn't quite ready yet... Follow the github project if you want to know when it's done. 

== Usage

GET '/' to see this README

POST '/' to see HTML output from the Pygments syntax highlighting library. Provide "lang" and "code" params, and you'll HTML back. 

  For example:

  POST http://pygments.appspot.com?lang=ruby&code=<%= 'hello world'.capitalize %>
  
  ...which would look like this, if properly escaped:
  
  POST /?lang=ruby&code=%3C%25=%20'hello%20world'.capitalize%20%25%3E
  
  ...would return:
  
  <table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&lt;%=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;hello world&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">capitalize</span> <span class="o">%&gt;</span>
  </pre></div>
  </td></tr></table>
  
  ...TODO need ruby example, and perhaps some CSS and a nice example...
