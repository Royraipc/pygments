== Welcome

http://pygments.appspot.com serves as a simple API to access the Pygments syntax highlighting library for Python. It's designed for use in web applications that can't support their own installation of Pygments. 

== Usage

GET '/' to see this README

POST '/' to see HTML output from the Pygments syntax highlighting library. Provide "lang" and "code" params, and you'll HTML back. 

  For example:

  POST http://pygments.appspot.com?lang=ruby&code=<%= 'hello world'.capitalize %>
  
  ...which would look like this, if properly escaped:
  
  POST /?lang=ruby&code=%3C%25=%20'hello%20world'.capitalize%20%25%3E
  
  ...would return:
  
  <table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&lt;%=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;hello world&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">capitalize</span> <span class="o">%&gt;</span>
  </pre></div>
  </td></tr></table>
